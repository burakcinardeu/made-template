# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
EV CO2  project.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How has the adoption of CO2 emissions by sectors in the USA affected global temperatures? 

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The transportation sector is a major conributer to CO2 emission in Europe. In order to protect environment the countries focused on using different alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles.This projects analyzes how has the adoption of electric vehicles in the UK affected annual CO2 emissions?  I aim to use regression analysis to answer this research question.
